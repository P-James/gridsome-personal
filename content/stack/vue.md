# **Vuejs**

Vuejs was a natural frontend choice when coming from a Laravel backend. I built
the frontend for [Educhina.co.uk](https://educhina.co.uk) using Vue, and I've
used Vuex and Vue Router where necessary too.

This site was built using Vue with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org).

Originally this site was a Vue SPA. But I had seen a lot of talk about the super
fast JAMstack - sites built with GraphQL data layers. I always wanted to learn
more about GraphQL, so I rebuilt this site using Gridsome.
