# **Vuejs**

Frontend framework of choice for large projects. I'm currently working with Vue 3 and Typescript.

This site was built using Vue 2 with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org).

This was an experiment to try out the JAM stack. I always wanted to learn more
about GraphQL, and this was my first go at using it. It's definitely overkill for a site
this size, but I enjoyed the learning experience. I've also used GraphQL with
[React](/React) in Next.js.
