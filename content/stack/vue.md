# **Vuejs**

Vuejs was a natural frontend choice when coming from a Laravel backend. I built
some frontend components for [Educhina.co.uk](https://educhina.co.uk) using Vue,
and I'm fairly familiar with most of the Vue ecosystem (Vuex, etc.).

This site was built using Vue with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org).

This was an experiment to try out the JAM stack. I always wanted to learn more
about GraphQL, and this was my first go at using it. It's overkill for a site
this size, but I enjoyed the learning experience. I've since used GraphQL with
[React](/React) in Nextjs too.
