# **Tailwind CSS**

I'm not a graphic designer but I want my projects to look good! Ideally without
spending too long tinkering with the CSS.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is the best solution for that and I
implement it in nearly every project. I've learnt a bit about front-end config
and build flow in the process.
