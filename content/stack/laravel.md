# **Laravel**

Backend framework of choice. I love building custom apps with Laravel. You can see a recent example at [www.realvoice.io](https://www.realvoice.io). This side-project was built with the 'VILT' stack (Vue, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind), and deployed to Vapor. I've also made use of several packages and third party API's (Laravel Scout, IBM Cloud, Lexicala dictionary), and integrated other third party packages on the front end. 

Besides Laravel I have also used some 'headless' services as backends when clients need more control (Sanity, Contentful, Strapi).
