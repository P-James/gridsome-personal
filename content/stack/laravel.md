# **Laravel**

Laravel has been the cornerstone of learning to code for me. Having started with
Python and then moving to Javascript and PHP, it wasn't until I got really stuck
in with Laravel that backend structure and OOP began to click.

You can see an example of my most recent commercial work with Laravel at:
[Educhina.co.uk](https://educhina.co.uk)

I'm also familiar with Wordpress and have built sites such as
[LipleyAndParker.com](http://lipleyandparker.com) using that as a backend (I'm going to rebuild this with Next or Nuxt in the near future).
