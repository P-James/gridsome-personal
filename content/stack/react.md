# **React**

Here's some work I recently did using React:

[WAJStudio](waj-frontend.vercel.app/)

It's a NextJs frontend hosted on Vercel, and Strapi CMS with Graphql backend (hosted on Heroku). Although I am more confortable with Vue, I chose React on this site as a challenge to get more familiar with the framework. I built all the components (and GraphQL queries) from scratch, so it was a good learning
experience.
