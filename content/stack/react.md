# **React**

Here's some work I did using React:

[WAJStudio](https://waj-frontend.vercel.app/)

It's a NextJs frontend hosted on Vercel and Strapi CMS backend with Graphql
hosted on Heroku. Although I am more confortable with Vue, I built all the React
components (and GraphQL queries) from scratch, so it was a good learning
experience.
