# **React**

I learnt Vue first, but React seems like an expected skill for developers these days so I completed a Udemy course and built a few different projects with Next.js to get an understanding of it.

This site is a Next.js frontend hosted on Vercel, and Sanity CMS with Graphql backend (hosted on Netlify). I built all the components from scratch, so it was a good learning experience.
