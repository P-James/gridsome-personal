# **Javascript**

Javascript deserves a special mention because it's often overlooked when
discussing all-powerful frameworks. Depending on the requirements of the
project, I'll still code some vanilla javascript on occassion, such as the
slideshow and mobile menu open function on
[LipleyAndParker.com](http://lipleyandparker.com).
