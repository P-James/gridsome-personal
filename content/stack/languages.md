# **Languages**

I have always enjoyed learning human languages. In the past I have spoken
French, Mandarin and Spanish fluently. I graduated with a first class honors in
Mandarin with French in 2016. Right now, my French and Spanish are extremely out
of practice, and my Mandarin is fading, but I am still fairly fluent.

I have recently started learning Korean, but at a slow pace. The majority of my
learning time is spent debugging or learning new code.
